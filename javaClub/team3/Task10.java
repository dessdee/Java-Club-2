/*      Everybody knows the classic "half your age plus seven" dating rule that a lot of people follow (including myself).
        It's the 'recommended' age range in which to date someone.


        minimum age <= your age <= maximum age #Task

        Given an integer (1 <= n <= 100) representing a person's age, return their minimum and maximum age range.

        This equation doesn't work when the age <= 14, so use this equation instead:

        min = age - 0.10 * age
        max = age + 0.10 * age
        You should floor all your answers so that an integer is given instead of a float (which doesn't represent age).
        Return your answer in the form [min]-[max]

        ##Examples:

        age = 27   =>   20-40
        age = 5    =>   4-5
        age = 17   =>   15-20*/
